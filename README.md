# IA-PROJECTS
In this first Project, I created a regressive model that will predict if the review from an user will be positive or negative.
- How this AI will learn which comments or reviews are positive or negative?
+ I used the database from IMDb dataset, that gives a lot of information to make the difference between positive and negative reviews.
- What did you do to make a good analysis of the review?
+ I used the library sklearn and using specificly the HashingVectorized. This library will help us to transform all the words into vectors and making a cross-validation between the good and the bad reviews. 
**Special and additional information.
For this project I created a Flask application to deploy a visual deployment to make more understandable the code for another user.
